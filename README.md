(nit)Picky explains acronyms used in your channels. Invite Picky; it will respond with an explanation every time someone uses an acronym. 

Picky will remember all the acronyms that it has listened to and explain. However, Picky will make up random acronym meanings, so you better make it learn the good ones!
