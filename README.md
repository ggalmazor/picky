(nit)Picky explains the acronyms that you use in Slack:
- Invite Picky to a channel, and it will listen to what you say
- Picky will define an acronym when someone uses it.
- Picky remembers all the acronyms that have been explained. However, Picky makes up random definitions, so you better teach it the good ones!
