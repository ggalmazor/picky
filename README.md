(nit)Picky explains the acronyms that you use in Slack:
- Invite Picky to a channel, and it will listen to messages
- Picky will write a message with a definition whenever someone uses an acronym 
- Picky remembers all the acronyms that it defines. However, Picky makes up random definitions, so you better teach it the good ones!

## How can Picky help your team?

Picky can make it easier for new team members by allowing them to understand what everybody else is talking about.

At Picky we're big fans of the "expose your ignorance" principle, but having the option to privately ask Picky about acronyms removes the awkwardness from the equation while a new team member gains confidence to do so in a public environment.

Here are some specific scenarios where Picky can help:

- **Onboarding of new team members**: Onboarding new team members into the domain-specific language and idioms of a team is easier when Picky can explain the acronyms used by others.

- **Helping non-native speakers blend in**: Non-native speaker team members might struggle with acronyms commonly used in the main language that's used to communicate in Slack. With Picky, you can finally what IIRC or BBIAB mean ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
- **Ensure everyone's talking about the same thing**: Just in case, Picky can help focus the conversation on the same topic by explicitly communicating what the acronym really means. Was it "Continuous Delivery" or "Continuous Deployment"?
